# deep-learning-challenge

Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization, is seeking an effective tool to aid in the selection of funding applicants who have the highest potential for success in their endeavors. Leveraging your expertise in machine learning and neural networks, you will utilize the dataset's features to construct a binary classifier. This classifier's purpose is to predict the likelihood of applicants achieving success if supported by Alphabet Soup's funding.
